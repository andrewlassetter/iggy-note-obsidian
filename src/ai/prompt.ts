${contextHint}Identify the recording type:
- "MEETING" — group discussion or call with 3 or more people
- "ONE_ON_ONE" — conversation between exactly two people (1:1 meeting, interview, pair call)
- "MEMO" — one person capturing their own thoughts, ideas, to-dos, or reflections
- "JOURNAL" — personal journal entry: reflective, introspective, or diary-style
- "LECTURE" — a one-sided talk: class, presentation, conference talk, or speech. The recorder is a passive listener.

Return a JSON object with ALL of these fields:

{
  "noteType": "MEETING" | "ONE_ON_ONE" | "MEMO" | "JOURNAL" | "LECTURE",

  "title": "A specific, descriptive title (5–8 words). Useful months from now — not 'Team meeting' but 'Q3 launch timeline and owner assignments'.",

  "summary": "2–3 concise sentences. High-level overview of what happened and the main outcome. Scannable at a glance.",

  "keyTopics": [
    {
      "topic": "Primary topic or theme from the recording",
      "bullets": ["Concise point", "Another point — keep these tight"]
    }
  ],

  "content": [
    "First prose paragraph capturing key ideas or context...",
    "Second paragraph — a distinct theme or thread..."
  ],

  "decisions": [
    "A fact: something explicitly decided OR completed/resolved during this recording"
  ],

  "keyTerms": ["term1", "term2"],

  "actionItems": [
    {
      "content": "Task starting with a verb",
      "owner": "Name of the person responsible, or null",
      "context": "One sentence: why this matters or what it unblocks"
    }
  ]
}

Rules — read carefully:
- summary: 2–3 sentences only. High-level, scannable. Never a list.
- keyTopics: 3–6 topics covering the main threads. 2–4 concise bullets per topic. For memos, these are the main themes or ideas discussed.
- content: 2–4 prose paragraphs. For meetings, a narrative recap. For memos, the key ideas expanded. Always populate even if it covers similar ground to keyTopics.
- decisions: things explicitly decided, AND things completed or resolved during the recording (e.g. "deleted the project", "agreed to skip the release"). Stated as facts.
- keyTerms: ONLY for LECTURE type. Flat list of technical terms, concepts, or frameworks introduced. Strings only. Return [] or omit for all other types.
- actionItems: ONLY work that remains to be done AFTER this recording ends. If something was completed, decided, or resolved during the recording itself — it belongs in decisions, NOT actionItems.
- NO DUPLICATE items between decisions and actionItems. If an item could fit both, put it in decisions.
- If no actionItems exist, use []. If no decisions were made, use [].

For LECTURE recordings:
- summary: 2–4 sentences capturing the lecture's central thesis or learning objective.
- keyTopics: the main concepts or arguments covered IN ORDER they were presented. Each bullet should be a complete, informative sentence. Aim for 5–8 highlights across 2–5 topic groups.
- keyTerms: flat list of technical terms or key vocabulary introduced. Return [] if none.
- decisions: return [] — lectures have no decisions.
- actionItems: follow-up tasks for the listener only (assigned reading, practice, topics to research). Return [] if none mentioned.
- Do NOT attribute statements to speakers by name.
